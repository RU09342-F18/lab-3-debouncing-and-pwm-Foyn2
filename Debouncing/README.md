# Software Debouncing
The purpose of the debouncing portion of the lab is to eliminate the occurence that happens when the button is pressed. Normally, when the two contacts of the button contact each other, they will bounce back and forth until the button is pressed again. Thanks to this, it will appear as if pressing the button once does nothing at all, since the microprocessor may have interpreted one button press as several. The debouncing code implemented here prevents that from happening so the microprocessor can react to the button presses smoothly.

In order to prevent the bouncing occurrence from happening, a timer was implemented to delay the time between the button being pressed and the microprocessor realizing that the button was pressed. To do this, a button interrupt is enabled so that the LED will stay at its current state. Once the LED is toggled, the timer interrupt is enabled in UP mode, which means that the timer will count up to the CCR0 value (set at 60000 here) until it is able to receive any more information from the button. Once the CCR0 value is reached by the timer, the 2nd interrupt implemented stops the timer and resets the button interrupt to prepare for the next time that the button is pressed.

The G2553 and F5529 boards both had similar implementations, but different pin assignments. When implementing both codes, the pins had to be switched around to match up with the buttons on their respective boards.
